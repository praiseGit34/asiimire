        When the Franciscan Sisters from Breda in the Netherlands arrived in Kabale Diocese in 1963, they had a dream and a job to do.
        Healthcare services in the region were in very short supply, and yet malaria and other tropical diseases were in abundance. This is what moved the sisters to give all they had to turn an already existing Dispensary into a community Hospital. And so Nyakibale Hospital came to be, named after Karoli Lwanga the Head of the 22 Catholic Uganda martyrs who were later canonized in 1964. Starting with only 85 beds, the newly found Hospital conducted 350 deliveries in the year of its establishment! 53 years down the road, the Hospital has evolved commensurate to the healthcare needs of its catchment population. Functioning as the Referral Hospital for Rukungiri District, the facility has grown into a vast complex, employing 170 people, and serving over 40,000 patients per year.
